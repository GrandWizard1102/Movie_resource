The Movie Database Management System (MDMS) is a Java-based application with an Oracle database backend, designed to manage and explore movie-related data efficiently. 
It allows users to browse movies, rate and review them, while administrators can add, update, and delete movie, actor, and director records.
The system employs a structured database schema to store information about movies, genres, actors, directors, and user ratings, ensuring seamless interaction through a user-friendly interface. 
JDBC is used for database connectivity, making the system robust, scalable, and well-integrated.
