The Hostel Pass Management System is a C++ program that streamlines the process of hostel pass applications. Students can apply for passes by selecting their room and entering leave & arrival dates, while the Resident Councillor (RC) can approve or deny requests through a secure portal. The system uses a Binary Search Tree (BST) to manage room assignments and dynamically tracks application statuses with color-coded indicators. This project enhances efficiency in managing student movement within hostels.
